                This is a fake e-commerce website designed by Drew Cook.
                <br />
                Drew was originally inspired to create a modern alternative to e-commerce after his Web Development instructor posted a project explicitly telling him to do so.
                <br />
                Today Drew spends his days and nights debugging this very website and others plagued by bugs just like it.
